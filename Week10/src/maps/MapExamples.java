 * Maps keep track of key/value pairs
 * Keys are unique (no duplicates) 
 * Map is an interface and TreeMap and HashMap are classes which implement this interface
 * TreeMap is fast and maintains the KEYS in sorted order
 * HashMap is faster but does not maintain the KEYS in any order
 * 
 * Replace Key and Value with Object Types
 * Map<Key, Value> map= new HashMap<Key,Value>();
 * Map<Key, Value> map= new TreeMap<Key,Value>();
 * 
 * This class will keep track of words and their definitions in a HashMap
 * Map (word, defintions)
 * Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<String, String>();
